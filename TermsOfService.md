Effective Date: June 16th, 2025
Owned by: Nirmini Development
Maintained by: Nirmini Engineering & Development Division
Support Server: https://discord.gg/73bRjVBRzr
1. User Requirements

    You must be 13 years of age or older, or meet your region’s digital service minimum.

    You agree to comply with applicable laws and Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines while using Nova.

    By authorizing Nova for use in your server or account, you agree to these Terms.

2. Responsible Use

You must not:

    Use Nova for malicious activity (e.g., raiding, harassment, scams, or server nuking).

    Reverse-engineer, clone, or attempt to bypass Nova's systems unless licensed for such use.

    Exploit features in unintended ways, including excessive spamming or disruptive automation.

3. Developer Integrity

Nova is committed to safe, ethical bot operation:

    No Destructive Features: Nova is not designed for and will not be used for destructive purposes (e.g., mass channel/role deletion).

    Safe Handling: Nova operates only with necessary permissions and does not log messages or sensitive content without user activation.

    Transparent Management: Major updates will be disclosed clearly through documentation or the support server.

4. Data Collection

We collect only the data required to support Nova’s functionality:

    User, server, and channel IDs

    Command configurations, settings, and moderation logs (if enabled)

    Email addresses collected through Discord OAuth2 on our website

We do not sell or share this data externally. All data is securely stored and only accessed by authorized Nirmini engineers.
5. Community Standards

Nirmini Development encourages—but does not require—communities using Nova to align with the following principles:

    Stay Family-Friendly: No NSFW/NSFL, roleplay, e-dating, or controversial political/religious content.

    Respect Users: No harassment, doxing, elitism, slurs, or trauma dumping.

    Avoid Mini-Modding and Witch Hunts.

While no direct action will be taken against non-compliant servers, such communities may be ineligible for early-access features, beta programs, and other developer-led initiatives.
6. Access & Enforcement

We reserve the right to:

    Suspend or restrict access to Nova in any server where misuse is detected

    Deny participation in exclusive or preview programs if a server’s conduct conflicts with our principles

    Update or revoke features where required for user safety or Discord platform compliance

These actions are not punitive and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
7. Changes to These Terms

These Terms of Service may be updated at any time. Material changes will be posted in:

    Nova’s Support Server

    Official documentation or changelogs

Your continued use of Nova after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
